        <h1>Same Taste, Different Brand?</h1>
        <h2>Coca-Cola Company vs. PepsiCo Inc.</h2>
        <h3>By Komal Aheer</h3>

        <p>
            The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) have been two of the most dominant faces in the beverage industry. 
            They've brought a wide variety of commonly consumed beverages including 
            <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/brands/product-information">Pepsi's</a> 7up, Gatorade, Brisk iced tea, 
            and Mountain Dew as well as 
            <a href="https://www.coca-cola.ca/brands/coca-cola">Coca-Cola's</a> Nestea, Minute Maid, Five Alive, Fruitopia, 
            Sprite, Powerade, Fresca,
            and Sprite. Of course who can forget, the two companies' infamous beverages Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Though some 
            people can't taste the difference, the two companies are very different. So, which one is worth the investment?
            Who's the real winner in this war of Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi?
        </p>
        <p>
            To gain some insight into this, historical stock market data was taken from
            <a href="https://learn.macewan.ca/bbcswebdav/pid-2054875-dt-content-rid-8381171_1/xid-8381171_1">DRiP investment</a>. 
            As it turns out, PepsiCo has shown a greater increase in dividend yield throughout the years than Coca-Cola has. This has been
            the case since 1999. Although they were experiencing a similar rate of growth from 1999 to the early 2000's, the gap between 
            them quickly grew with Pepsi coming out on top. Although annual changes in dividend yield are not the only indicator of the 
            value of a company, based on these results, Pepsi is the clear winner.

        <h2>Design Decisions & Justification</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A line chart was thought to be the best way to display this data as the goal was to display trends in dividend
                yields. Line charts are very effective for showing trends over time.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to place emphasis on the trends themselves, the axes are colored grey. This way they don't take attention
                away from the trends. Other visual elements such as gridlines were not included in order to reduce clutter.
            </li>
            <li>
                The data points were included in the chart to support hover interactions. When the user hovers over them, they can 
                see details pertaining to the specific dividend yield at that point in time. This allows them to easily compare 
                the two companies' values.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the user hovers over a trend, the opposing trend becomes a lighter color. This is used to emphasize one trend 
                over the other. In addition, for areas of the chart where the lines are close together, such as the very beginning, this highlight 
                allows the user to clearly see which trend they are hovering over. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The colors used correspond to the brand colors of Pepsi and Coca Cola. Given the popularity of these brands, it's expected
                that the users will be familiar with these colors. Hence, it is expected that viewers will easily be able to understand
                which line applies to which company.
            </li>
            <li>
                In addition to the color choice, the company's ticker symbol is displayed right next to the line that it corresponds to. 
                This supports easy lookup in case the user is unfamiliar with the brand colors. 
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Rules of Thumb Supported </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>Get it Right in Black and White</em> - This design is not heavily reliant on colors. The user can infer the company from
                the ticker symbol.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Responsiveness is Required</em> - The design includes immediate visual feedback when the user hovers over a trend
                or data point. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Eyes Beat Memory</em> - As mentioned previously, the user can infer the company from the ticker symbol right beside
                the line it's assoiciated with. In addition, the user can hover over a point to see the dividend yield for a particular year. 
            </li>
        </ul>
