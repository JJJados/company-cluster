## Features

- Filteration on select attributes, sector, or both.

- Click and comparing companies via a line graph and table showing the historical dividend yield and highlighting the best attributes between the two companies.

Future improvments will (hopefully) be made during our freetime to update styling, code structure, and overall add new features to this project.
